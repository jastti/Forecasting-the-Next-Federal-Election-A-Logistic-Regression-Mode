# Forecasting-the-Next-Federal-Election-A-Logistic-Regression-Mode

The project "Forecasting the Next Federal Election: A Logistic Regression Model" focuses on predicting the outcome of the Canadian federal election using logistic regression. This analysis involves a detailed examination of factors such as age, province, citizenship status, family income, marital status, and sex to understand their impact on voting behaviour. The project is grounded in a methodical approach that includes thorough data cleaning, model building, and post-stratification adjustments. It aims to offer a nuanced understanding of voter preferences and the likelihood of different political parties winning the election. This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the interplay of various socio-demographic factors in shaping election outcomes.
